<h1>This or That</h1>
<h2>A Survey App</h2>
"This or That" is a team project that included myself, Jean, Jesse, and Louis. "This or That" is a survey app that is focused on building a better working enviornment. Users can login, create a survey that people can then vote on. At this point, Users can create a survey that has only two options. We feel that by using this app, it will bring co-workers closer together and showcase interest, or dislikes, between them as well.

<h2> Planning Process </h2>
  <p> Our team spent the first day of our project sprint, planning out the design and structure of our project.  Every day we held a stand up meeting first thing in the morning.  Additionally, mid-day we would hold a regroup to ensure the entire team was on the same page and we knew the user stories that needed to be addressed moving forward.  When our team ran into issues we would first try and troubleshoot doing research.  If the research process was not succesful, we would then group as a team to see if we could combine our knowledge to address the problem.  If that measure proved to be unsuccesful, our team would submit an issue in the queue to work with the instructors to problem solve.  This process allowed us to have well though out issues when it got to that stage, which led to the problem being solved more efficiently.  Constantly communicating, our team was able to iterate quickly with our API structure, as well as improve the design of our client.  Effective planning and constant communication was the key to meeting successful requirements.</p>
