<h1>This or That</h1>


<h2>A Survey App</h2>

"This or That" is a team project that included myself, Jean, Jesse, and Louis. "This or That" is a survey app that is focused on building a better working enviornment. Users can login, create a survey that people can then vote on. At this point, Users can create a survey that has only two options. We feel that by using this app, it will bring co-workers closer together and showcase interest, or dislikes, between them as well.
